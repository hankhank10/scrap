# scrap
 
scrap() is an easy way of working out what is going on within your python scripts even if you don't have access to where the terminal where they are running - say there's a GUI which takes the full screen or you are on a remote headless server

It can direct output - either manually or automatically - to a "scrap" which you can create at http://scrap.hankapi.com/

All that is needed to run this is putting scrap.py (lightweight and open source) in your project folder.  No pips, no dependencies, nothing to install, distribute right with your projects.

## Installation

Copy scrap.py to your project folder.

Initialise in each file you plan to use it in with: ```import scrap```

Set up the scrap (one time) using ```scrap.setup("your-scrap-name")```

## Manual usage

Scrap can report things manually using the following syntax:

```scrap.write ("Your text)```

See example-code.py for a full example.

## Automatic usage

It can also be set to automatically output all future screen output or error output to your scrap:

```scrap.auto_scrap_on_print()```
```scrap.auto_scrap_on_error()```

See example-code-automatic.py for a full example.
